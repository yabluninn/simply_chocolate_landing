              Milk chocolate is a solid chocolate confectionery containing
              cocoa, sugar and milk. It is the most consumed type of chocolate.
              Chocolate was originally sold and consumed as a beverage in
              pre-Columbian times. Although four-fifths of all milk chocolate is
              sold in the United States and Europe.

              Semi-sweet chocolate has a cocoa solid content of 35 to 65%. One
              of the best ways to gain an understanding of this type of
              chocolate is to compare it to a different type of chocolate.
              Semisweet is darker than milk chocolate. In a taste comparison, it
              has a slightly bitter taste whereas milk chocolate is sweeter and
              more mellow.
